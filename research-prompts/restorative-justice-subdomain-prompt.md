- How do different restorative approaches affect victim healing and closure?
- What conditions enable victims to feel genuinely heard and validated in justice processes?
- How do restorative justice outcomes compare to traditional prosecution in addressing victim needs?
- What role should victims play in determining appropriate responses to harm?

### Offender Accountability and Rehabilitation
- What evidence shows that restorative justice produces genuine accountability versus mere apologizing?
- How do restorative approaches affect recidivism compared to incarceration?
- What conditions enable authentic remorse and behavior change in those who cause harm?
- How can restorative processes distinguish between genuine accountability and manipulation?
- What support systems help offenders make meaningful amends and avoid future harm?

### Community Healing and Prevention
- How do restorative justice processes affect broader community trust and cohesion?
- What evidence exists for community-based prevention of future harm through restorative approaches?
- How can restorative justice address systemic patterns of harm while maintaining individual focus?
- What role do communities play in supporting both victims and those seeking to make amends?
- How do restorative approaches build community capacity for conflict resolution?

### Process Design and Implementation
- What procedural elements are essential for effective restorative justice processes?
- How should restorative justice processes be adapted for different types of harm and relationships?
- What training and qualifications are needed for effective restorative justice facilitators?
- How can restorative processes maintain safety for all participants?
- What safeguards prevent restorative justice from becoming coercive or manipulative?

### Integration with Formal Justice Systems
- How can restorative approaches be integrated with traditional legal systems?
- What evidence exists for pre-prosecution diversion versus post-conviction restorative justice?
- How do different legal frameworks support or hinder effective restorative justice?
- What oversight mechanisms ensure restorative justice maintains quality and fairness?
- How can restorative approaches handle cases where offenders deny responsibility?

## Research Methodology Guidelines
- **Longitudinal outcome studies**: Track victim healing, offender behavior change, and community effects over time
- **Comparative analysis**: Compare restorative versus traditional justice outcomes across different harm types
- **Participant voice research**: Center the experiences and perspectives of those who have been through restorative processes
- **Cultural competency analysis**: Examine how restorative approaches work across different cultural contexts
- **Safety assessment**: Evaluate safeguards against re-victimization and manipulation

## Output Requirements
- Evidence-based frameworks for victim-centered restorative processes
- Guidelines for genuine accountability versus performative apology
- Best practices for community involvement in restorative justice
- Training materials for restorative justice facilitators
- Integration models for restorative approaches within formal justice systems
- Safety protocols for all participants in restorative processes
- Outcome measurement tools for restorative justice effectiveness

## Research Priorities
1. **Victim satisfaction and healing**: Comprehensive analysis of what victims need from justice processes
2. **Authentic accountability**: Research on what produces genuine behavior change versus mere compliance
3. **Community restoration**: Evidence on how restorative approaches affect broader social relationships
4. **Process integrity**: Study of what makes restorative justice effective versus tokenistic
5. **Cultural adaptation**: How restorative approaches work across different communities and traditions
6. **Safety and protection**: Ensuring restorative processes don't enable further harm
7. **System integration**: Effective ways to incorporate restorative approaches in formal justice systems

## Specific Areas of Investigation

- Family group conferencing and community accountability processes
- Victim-offender mediation and dialogue programs
- Community service and restitution programs
- Truth and reconciliation processes in post-conflict societies
- Indigenous and traditional justice practices

## Avoid
- Approaches that prioritize offender comfort over victim healing
- Processes that pressure victims to forgive or participate
- Restorative justice as a cost-saving measure that compromises quality
- One-size-fits-all approaches that ignore harm type and relationship dynamics
- Processes that enable manipulation or avoid genuine accountability
- Research that conflates restorative justice with mere conflict resolution
