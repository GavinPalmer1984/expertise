# Justice and Restitution Domain Research Prompt

## Research Focus
Investigate evidence-based approaches to justice that prioritize addressing specific claims of injury, providing proportional restitution, enabling genuine redemption, and facilitating voluntary forgiveness processes.

## Key Research Questions

### Core Justice Principles
- What does research show about the effectiveness of restorative vs. retributive justice approaches?
- How do different justice systems handle claims of injury and what outcomes do they produce for victims?
- What evidence exists for optimal restitution approaches that actually make victims whole?
- What conditions enable genuine accountability and redemption rather than mere punishment?
- How do voluntary forgiveness processes work and what supports their success?

### Due Process and Procedural Fairness
- What procedural protections most effectively prevent false accusations while ensuring victim voices are heard?
- How do different evidence standards affect justice outcomes for both accusers and accused?
- What role does expertise play in adjudication and how can it be properly incorporated?
- How do fair investigation processes balance thoroughness with timeliness?
- What safeguards prevent ideological capture of justice institutions?

### Historical Lessons and Failures
- What can we learn from justice system failures like Salem witch trials, McCarthyism, or campus kangaroo courts?
- How have societies successfully transitioned from revenge-based to restoration-based justice?
- What evidence exists about the effectiveness of Truth and Reconciliation processes?
- How do proportionality failures in justice responses affect community trust and cohesion?
- What patterns emerge when justice systems are captured by ideological movements?

### Community Healing and Restoration
- How do different approaches to justice affect broader community relationships and trust?
- What evidence exists for community-based conflict resolution versus formal legal processes?
- How can justice processes address systemic patterns of harm while maintaining individual case focus?
- What role do communities play in supporting both victims and those seeking redemption?
- How do different cultural approaches to justice and restoration compare in outcomes?

## Research Methodology Guidelines
- **Evidence-based analysis**: Focus on measurable outcomes rather than ideological frameworks
- **Comparative case studies**: Examine different justice approaches and their actual results
- **Victim-centered research**: Prioritize research that examines victim satisfaction and healing
- **Proportionality assessment**: Evaluate whether justice responses match the scope of actual harm
- **Long-term outcome tracking**: Study whether justice processes actually prevent future harm and enable healing

## Output Requirements
- Practical frameworks for receiving and investigating claims of injury
- Evidence-based best practices for restitution and restoration processes
- Case studies of successful restorative justice implementations
- Guidelines for maintaining procedural fairness while addressing victim needs
- Analysis of what enables genuine accountability versus mere punishment
- Research on community healing approaches that actually work
- Historical analysis of justice system failures and their causes

## Research Priorities
1. **Restorative justice effectiveness**: Comprehensive analysis of victim outcomes, offender rehabilitation, and community healing
2. **Due process protection**: Research on procedural safeguards that protect both accusers and accused
3. **Proportional response**: Evidence on what constitutes proportional justice responses to different types of harm
4. **Redemption pathways**: Analysis of what enables genuine accountability and restoration
5. **Truth-seeking processes**: Research on investigation methods that uncover facts rather than confirm biases
6. **Community healing**: Evidence on approaches that restore rather than divide communities
7. **Institutional protection**: Research on preventing ideological capture of justice institutions

## Avoid
- Ideological frameworks that predetermine outcomes
- Group identity-based approaches to individual justice claims
- Research that conflates justice with broader political agendas
- Analysis that dismisses either victim needs or due process protections
- Approaches that deny the possibility of redemption and restoration
- Research that ignores proportionality between harm and response
