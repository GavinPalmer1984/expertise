# Expertise Repository

A structured collection of expertise across multiple domains, designed to be transformed into:
1. MCP servers for AI tools
2. Books and educational materials
3. Static website for sharing and linking

## Purpose

This repository exists to systematically **curate and cultivate expertise** that helps people become good - learning to love life, people, and all creation, and excelling in their essential roles as neighbors, children, students, teachers, and parents. 

The foundational principle is that we need good AI in the hands of all people of all ages, helping them along the way and training them to be good. This is especially important because we have many bad examples in the world - poor parents, governments, teachers, and neighbors - and AI can help fill the gap by providing the good guidance that many people lack.

By:
- **Curating**: Collecting knowledge about what it means to be good and how to help others become better
- **Cultivating**: Growing expertise in moral development, character formation, and helping the immature become mature
- **Serving**: Creating AI systems that can recognize daily moral patterns and provide gentle, wise correction

The goal is to create a knowledge base that enables AI to be a moral development partner, helping people become better in their relationships and roles.

## Structure

Expertise is organized hierarchically by domains, from general to specialized. Each domain contains:
- Knowledge
- Best practices
- Anti-patterns
- Failures and lessons learned

## Domains

### Foundational Domain
- **Morality** - Understanding what it means to be good (loving life, people, and creation) and how to help people become better neighbors, children, students, teachers, and parents. This serves as the foundation for all other expertise, especially for AI systems designed to help the immature become mature.

### Core Human Domains
- Community
- Economics
- Education
- Health
- Psychology
- Sociology
- Technology

### Peace and Flourishing Domains
- Peace Building
- Human Flourishing
- Environmental Stewardship
- Justice and Restitution
- Compassion Cultivation
- Spiritual Wisdom
- Regenerative Systems
- Global Cooperation

### Protective and Educational Domains
- Ethical Force
- Boundaries and Limits
- Protective Intervention
- Constructive Confrontation
- Educational Discipline
- Just Authority

### Specialized Domains
- Fishing
- (More to be added)

## For Expert Researchers

We have generated **108 customized research prompts** to help expert researchers contribute their knowledge across all domains and subdomains. These prompts are specifically designed to:

- Guide comprehensive knowledge contribution
- Document best practices and anti-patterns
- Capture lessons learned from failures
- Focus on peace, human flourishing, and love for all creation

See `research-prompts/README.md` for the complete list of prompts, or generate fresh prompts with:
```
npm run generate:research-prompts
```

## Transformation

The repository is designed with transformation in mind:
- MCP server transformation follows the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)
- Book transformation includes structure for chapters, examples, and exercises
- Static website transformation for browsable, linkable content sharing
