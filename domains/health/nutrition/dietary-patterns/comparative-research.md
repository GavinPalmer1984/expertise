# Comparative Dietary Research

## Overview
This document provides a framework for comparing different dietary approaches, with a specific focus on plant-based diets versus animal-based diets (carnivore/ketogenic), examining their impacts on health conditions such as heart disease and diabetes.

## Research Framework

### Key Figures and Sources to Research

#### Animal-Based Diet Advocates:
- Nick Norwitz (PhD from Oxford, researcher on ketogenic diets)
- Chris Palmer (Harvard psychiatrist, ketogenic diet for mental health)
- Ben Bikman (metabolic scientist studying insulin resistance)
- Research on lean mass hyper responders (LMHR)

#### Plant-Based Diet Advocates:
- [Add specific researchers/clinicians mentioned by user's wife]
- Dean Ornish (lifestyle interventions and heart disease reversal)
- Caldwell Esselstyn (plant-based diet and heart disease)
- Neal Barnard (plant-based diet and diabetes)

### Key Health Outcomes to Compare
- Cardiovascular health markers
- Diabetes management and insulin sensitivity
- Metabolic health indicators
- Long-term health outcomes
- Quality of life metrics

### Methodological Considerations
- Study designs (RCTs, observational studies, case series)
- Study duration (short-term vs. long-term outcomes)
- Population characteristics (general population vs. specific conditions)
- Confounding variables and how they're addressed
- Mechanisms of action proposed by each approach

## Research Organization Guidelines

### Evidence Classification
- Strong evidence (multiple RCTs or high-quality systematic reviews)
- Moderate evidence (limited RCTs, strong observational studies)
- Weak evidence (case series, mechanistic reasoning, clinical experience)
- Contradictory evidence (noting areas of scientific disagreement)

### Comparative Framework
For each health condition (heart disease, diabetes), organize findings by:

1. **Claims & Counter-claims**: What each dietary approach claims about the condition
2. **Mechanisms**: Proposed biological mechanisms for each approach
3. **Evidence Base**: Quality and quantity of evidence supporting each approach
4. **Clinical Outcomes**: Documented results in clinical settings
5. **Contextual Factors**: When and for whom each approach might be most appropriate
6. **Knowledge Gaps**: Areas requiring further research

## Avoiding Bias in Research
- Evaluate methodological quality independently of conclusions
- Consider funding sources and conflicts of interest
- Include evidence that contradicts preferred hypotheses
- Note limitations in all studies reviewed
- Distinguish between established facts, probable conclusions, and speculative reasoning
