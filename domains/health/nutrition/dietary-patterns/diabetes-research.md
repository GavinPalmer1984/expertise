# Diabetes and Dietary Approaches

## Overview
This document organizes research comparing plant-based and animal-based dietary approaches for diabetes prevention, management, and potential reversal.

## Research Framework for Diabetes

### Key Research Questions
1. How do different dietary patterns affect insulin sensitivity and glucose control?
2. What are the mechanisms by which these diets influence diabetes management?
3. How effective are different diets for weight management in diabetic patients?
4. What are the long-term outcomes for diabetes management with different dietary approaches?
5. Are there specific diabetes phenotypes that respond better to certain dietary patterns?

## Key Diabetes Metrics to Evaluate

### Blood Glucose Control
- Fasting blood glucose
- Postprandial glucose responses
- HbA1c
- Glycemic variability (if CGM data available)

### Insulin and Insulin Sensitivity
- Fasting insulin
- HOMA-IR
- Insulin response patterns
- C-peptide

### Metabolic Health
- Weight/BMI/body composition
- Visceral fat
- Blood pressure
- Lipid profiles

### Diabetes Complications
- Microvascular complications (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy)
- Macrovascular complications (cardiovascular events)
- Medication requirements (insulin, oral agents)
