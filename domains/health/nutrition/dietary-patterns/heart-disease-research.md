# Heart Disease and Dietary Approaches

## Overview
This document organizes research comparing plant-based and animal-based dietary approaches for heart disease prevention and treatment.

## Research Framework for Heart Disease

### Key Research Questions
1. How do different dietary patterns affect cardiovascular disease risk?
2. What are the mechanisms by which these diets influence heart health?
3. What does the evidence show regarding reversal or progression of atherosclerosis?
4. How do these diets affect various biomarkers related to heart disease?
5. Are there specific populations who respond differently to these dietary patterns?

## Key Heart Disease Metrics to Evaluate

### Standard Lipid Panel
- Total cholesterol
- LDL-C (including particle size and number if available)
- HDL-C
- Triglycerides

### Advanced Cardiovascular Markers
- ApoB/ApoA-1 ratio
- Lipoprotein(a)
- Inflammatory markers (hs-CRP, IL-6)
- Endothelial function
- Coronary calcium score
- CIMT (Carotid Intima-Media Thickness)

### Clinical Outcomes
- Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE)
- Angina symptoms
- Heart failure progression
- Need for interventions (stents, bypass)
- Quality of life
