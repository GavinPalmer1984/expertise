# Dietary Patterns Domain

## Overview
This domain examines various dietary patterns and approaches, their underlying principles, evidence base, and effects on health outcomes, with a particular focus on comparing different dietary philosophies.

## Knowledge
Recent research (2023-2025) reveals that both carnivore/ketogenic and plant-based approaches can produce positive health outcomes, but effectiveness varies significantly based on individual genetic factors, metabolic flexibility, and pre-existing conditions. The scientific consensus has shifted toward personalized nutrition rather than universal dietary recommendations.

Key insights include:
- Dramatic individual variation exists in responses to identical dietary interventions
- Genetic factors (including APOE variants) strongly influence optimal macronutrient ratios
- Metabolic flexibility determines adaptation to different dietary approaches
- Ultra-processed foods are universally problematic regardless of macronutrient composition

## Best Practices
- Match dietary approach to individual biology through personalized assessment
- Consider genetic variants affecting fat vs. carbohydrate metabolism
- Evaluate current metabolic flexibility and insulin sensitivity
- Assess gut microbiome composition and diversity
- Monitor inflammatory profile and food tolerances
- Align diet with lifestyle factors and health goals
- Focus on nutrient density and food quality regardless of dietary pattern
- Eliminate ultra-processed foods across all dietary approaches

## Anti-Patterns
- Universalizing dietary approaches without considering individual variation
- Focusing solely on macronutrient ratios while ignoring food quality
- Ignoring metabolic health markers when evaluating dietary success
- Using diet tribalism to dismiss contradictory evidence
- Applying cholesterol guidelines without considering phenotypical differences
- Making long-term recommendations based on short-term studies
- Failing to adapt dietary approaches as individual health status changes

## Failures and Lessons
- Single-nutrient focus (like saturated fat restriction) failed to address chronic disease comprehensively
- Dismissal of individual variation led to conflicting dietary research results
- Lack of phenotype identification caused confusing or contradictory outcomes in nutrition studies
- One-size-fits-all dietary guidelines failed to account for genetic diversity
- Short-term biomarker improvements don't always translate to long-term health outcomes
