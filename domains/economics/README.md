# Economics Domain

## Overview
This domain explores economic principles, systems, and practices with a particular focus on collaborative economics, resource distribution, and sustainable simplification. It examines how economic decisions affect individual and collective wellbeing, and how alternative economic models might better serve human needs.

## Knowledge
Economic systems fundamentally shape how we allocate resources, make decisions, and interact with each other. Key insights include:

- Traditional economic models often prioritize growth and consumption over sustainability and wellbeing
- Collaborative economic approaches (sharing economy, cooperatives, commons-based systems) can create more distributed value
- Resource distribution follows predictable patterns in various economic systems, often leading to concentration without intentional intervention
- Voluntary simplification can increase individual wellbeing while reducing environmental impact
- Economic decisions are deeply intertwined with psychological and social factors

## Best Practices
- Implement collaborative consumption and production models that maximize resource utilization
- Design economic incentives that align individual actions with collective wellbeing
- Practice intentional simplification to reduce unnecessary consumption while maintaining quality of life
- Create transparent systems for resource allocation that build trust and participation
- Balance efficiency with resilience in economic systems
- Develop skills for both self-sufficiency and interdependence
- Consider full lifecycle costs in economic decisions, including environmental and social impacts

## Anti-Patterns
- Assuming endless growth is possible or desirable in a finite system
- Measuring success solely through financial or material metrics
- Creating artificial scarcity to drive consumption and profits
- Externalizing true costs onto society, future generations, or the environment
- Allowing excessive accumulation that creates systemic instability
- Making decisions based on short-term gains that undermine long-term prosperity
- Prioritizing efficiency to the point of creating fragile, non-resilient systems

## Failures and Lessons
- Purely individualistic economic approaches often fail to address collective challenges
- Economic systems that ignore psychological realities (comfort-seeking, status competition) typically underperform
- Top-down resource allocation often leads to inefficiency and corruption
- Economic theories that don't account for real human behavior lead to unexpected outcomes
- Trust is a critical economic resource that, once lost, is difficult to rebuild
- Change resistance must be acknowledged and addressed for economic transitions
